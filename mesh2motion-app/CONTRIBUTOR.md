For developing the application and code base, the best way to start is to create an issue with the problem you are trying to solve. This will help with any discussion before you do too much work.

For contributions to the Blender 3d model and animation files, all that is done on a separate repository. You can learn more about that here: https://github.com/Mesh2Motion/mesh2motion-assets
